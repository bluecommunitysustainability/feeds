Food and climate are immediately related from growing to eating and wasting, which is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Cows burp methane; that is their nature. Unfortunately, methane is the worst greenhouse gas. No matter which innovations we came up with, cows still need to burp. It will never be zero. The cows need to feed to be the meat source for humans, which costs us more than plants for the same amount of nutrition for the human body. So cur</span>

RCP 8.5 has often been referred to as “business as usual.” It describes a world without action on climate policy and continued fossil fuel use expanding unchecked, leading to a truly apocalyptic future for our climate and everything living on our planet – including us.

It&#x27;s not that complicated! More energy is coming in than is going out because of WIGGLES. 

And yes, I&#x27;m talking about this because it feels like maybe MAYBE the US will have a climate bill that will actually, measurably reduce emissions on a fairly tight time scale which is massive.

                              <span>Hey Teachers and Parents! In this video we explore climate change for kids.  We learn all about the causes of climate change like the greenhouse effect, fossil fuel burning, farming, and even deforestation and why these are big dilemmas in today&#x27;s world.  We also cover ways that we can help prevent climate change and be friendlier to our environment including: walking, planting trees, using less electricity and other fun ways. 

We hope you and your students have fun as they learn about climate</span>
