                              <span>The collapse of society is rapidly accelerating. Global events are escalating at an alarming pace. We’re now witnessing conflicts erupting all over the world. At the same time, global production is declining, supply chain problems are getting bigger, and our economic woes are getting worse. In fact, according to a new reassessment of a report released by a team of MIT scientists in 1970, human society is right on track for a collapse in the next two decades if there isn&#x27;t a serious shift in glob...</span>

                              <span>Hey Teachers and Parents! In this video we explore climate change for kids.  We learn all about the causes of climate change like the greenhouse effect, fossil fuel burning, farming, and even deforestation and why these are big dilemmas in today&#x27;s world.  We also cover ways that we can help prevent climate change and be friendlier to our environment including: walking, planting trees, using less electricity and other fun ways. 

We hope you and your students have fun as they learn about climate</span>

                              <span>Climate change is now a bigger threat to elephant conservation than poaching, says Kenya&#x27;s Wildlife and Tourism ministry.

In the past year, the country has recorded 179 elephant deaths due to the ongoing drought affecting the Horn of Africa.

Following consecutive seasons of poor rains, rivers and water pans have dried up and grasslands have shrivelled in the game reserves.

Food and climate are immediately related from growing to eating and wasting, which is responsible for a third of greenhouse gas emissions. Cows burp methane; that is their nature. Unfortunately, methane is the worst greenhouse gas. No matter which innovations we came up with, cows still need to burp. It will never be zero. The cows need to feed to be the meat source for humans, which costs us more than plants for the same amount of nutrition for the human body. So cur</span>

A “tipping point” is when a system, with just a small amount of additional energy, is pushed from one stable state to another suddenly and dramatically. This can be a chair falling backwards. Or it can be a major earth system collapsing.
